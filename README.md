# SecHeaderFinding
This Python script checks for security headers from a provided URL. It sends a HEAD request to the URL and extracts common security-related headers like Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, and others. The script is designed to be executed from the command line, with the URL passed as an argument.
